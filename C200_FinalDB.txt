There has been a great deal of controversy in recent years about the role of fish oil in cardiovascular disease, with recent meta-analyses reaching different conclusions about its potential impact. The most promising evidence supports supplementation for prevention of cardiac death.', N'Researchers found that fish oil can help reduce the risk of diabetics from developing cognitive deficit because it protects the hippocampus cells from being destroyed.

It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function. It also functions as an antioxidant.', N'Vitamin C supplements help to boost people''s immunity, as vitamin C is involved in many parts of the immune system.

You stare are the computer screen all day, you use your smartphone before going to bed, you sleep late at night, these are elements that contribute towards decreased eye health, which in turn leads to disease and long term discomfort.
